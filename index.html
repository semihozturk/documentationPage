            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
            <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
                <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="main-section" id="hello_world">
            <header>Hello world</header>
            <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</p>
            <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
                greetMe("World");
            </code>
            <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!
            </p>
            
        </section>


        <section class="main-section" id="variables">
            <header>Variables</header>
            <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
            </p>

            <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>

        </section>



        <section class="main-section" id="declaring_variables">
            <header>Declaring variables</header>
            <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
            <p>With the keyword var. For example,</p>
            <code>var x = 42.</code>

            <p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
            </p>
            <p>By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>
            <code>x = 42.</code>

            <p>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
            </p>
            <p>With the keyword let. For example,</p>
            <code>let y = 13.</code>


        </section>



        <section class="main-section" id="constants">
            <header>Constants</header>
            <p>You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.</p>
            <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
